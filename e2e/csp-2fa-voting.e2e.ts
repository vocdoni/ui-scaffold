/**
 * Flow 2 — voting on a CSP census with an email 2FA challenge.
 *
 * The whole journey runs through the UI: the organizer signs up, verifies,
 * creates the organization, imports a memberbase, configures voter
 * authentication and publishes; the voter then identifies, receives an OTP by
 * email, submits it and casts a ballot. Nothing is provisioned behind the app's
 * back, so a break anywhere along that chain fails here.
