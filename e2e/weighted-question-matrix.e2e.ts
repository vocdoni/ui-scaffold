/**
 * Flow 3 — the process-creation matrix from the manual QA procedure, folded
 * into a single journey.
 *
 * The original checklist crossed census types (memberbase, spreadsheet, web3)
 * with question types and presentations. Two of those axes no longer exist:
 * the wizard only builds memberbase/CSP censuses now, and question type +
 * extended info became per-question settings — every question publishes as its
 * own on-chain election, so one process can carry the whole
 * single/multi × plain/extended matrix at once.
 *
 * The non-weighted single-choice-plain corner is already covered by
 * `csp-2fa-voting.e2e.ts`, so this spec takes the rest in one weighted
 * process: single+extended, multi+plain and multi+extended questions, voted in
 * one batch by a member whose voting power is 7. The weight is asserted at
 * both ends — the voter sees it before voting, and the public results tally 7
 * (not 1) per selected choice — which also proves the memberbase weight column
 * actually reached the census.
