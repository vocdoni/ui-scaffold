/**
 * Flow 4 — voting on an anonymous (blind CSP) census.
 *
 * Same journey as the CSP + 2FA flow, with one difference that changes the
 * whole cryptographic path: the organizer picks anonymous ballots, so the CSP
 * blind-signs a ballot it never sees (`blindPoint` → `blindSign`, a
 * `ECDSA_BLIND_PIDSALTED` proof) instead of signing the voter's address.
 *
 * Worth its own suite because nothing else exercises that path end to end, and
 * because a blind signature that is byte-wrong is rejected on chain with no
 * useful diagnostic — the vote count below is the only honest evidence it
 * worked.
