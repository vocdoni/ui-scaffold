# Vocdoni's UI Scaffold


## Development

This project was bootstrapped with
[Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), but we moved
to [vitejs](https://vitejs.dev).

### Environment variables

You can create a `.env.local` file to set your custom environment variables
there, here's a list of variables you can use:

- `VOCDONI_ENVIRONMENT`: the vocdoni environment to be used, either
  `dev`, `stg` or `prod` (defaults to `stg`).
- `BASE_URL` is used to specify the public base page during build.
- `BUILD_PATH` Specifies the destination of built files.
- `FAUCET_AMOUNT` The amount given in the faucet, to change it in visible places (defaults to `800`)
- `CUSTOM_ORGANIZATION_DOMAINS` A JSON.stringified object of custom domains mapped to organization ids, to
  replace the homepage with their profile page.

You can also start the app by prefixing these vars instead of defining your
custom `.env` file:

```bash
VOCDONI_ENVIRONMENT=dev yarn start
# or an example using all of them...
BUILD_PATH=build/dev BASE_URL=/ui-scaffold/dev VOCDONI_ENVIRONMENT=dev yarn build
```

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br /> Open
[http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to view it in the browser (note
the port may change if already used).

#### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.<br /> It correctly bundles
React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

#### `yarn translations`

Extracts all i18n strings from the code and puts them in the `i18n/locales` json
files. The best way to work with translations is:

### Branching and deploys

Three branches are linked to deploys:

- `develop`, deployed to [app-dev.vocdoni.io], and linked to api-dev.
- `stage`, deployed to [app-stg.vocdoni.io], and linked to api-stg.
- `main`, deployed to [app.vocdoni.io], and linked to LTS api (formerly prod).

Also, all pushes to develop are deployed twice to netlify (one for api-dev,
[the other for api-stg][netlify]). You can easily access these deploys on each
commit to develop, or directly in pull requests.

The common flow to follow when deploying to `main` is passing through all the
other stages:

    branch from develop => merge to develop => merge to stage => merge to main

The only exception should be when fixing specific versions to a deployment, in
such case, a hotfix should be created from the desired branch to be updated:

    branch from stage (i.e. h/sdk-0.4.1) => PR to stage
    branch from main (i.e. h/sdk-0.5.0) => PR to main
