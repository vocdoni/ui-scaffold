# ui-scaffold

Vocdoni's UI Scaffold is a React application that uses the [Vocdoni SDK](https://developer.vocdoni.io/sdk) and [UI Components library](https://developer.vocdoni.io/ui-components) to provide a user interface for the Vocdoni voting protocol.
It is built with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/) and is deployed at https://app.vocdoni.io/.

## Getting Started

### Environment variables

You can create a `.env.local` file to set your custom environment variables
there, here's a list of variables you can use:

- `VOCDONI_ENVIRONMENT`: the vocdoni environment to be used, either
  `dev`, `stg` or `prod` (defaults to `stg`).
- `BASE_URL` is used to specify the public base page during build.
- `BUILD_PATH` Specifies the destination of built files.
- `CUSTOM_ORGANIZATION_DOMAINS` A JSON.stringified object of custom domains mapped to organization ids, to
  replace the homepage with their profile page.

You can also start the app by prefixing these vars instead of defining your
custom `.env` file:

```bash
VOCDONI_ENVIRONMENT=dev yarn start
# or an example using many of them...
BUILD_PATH=build/dev BASE_URL=/ui-scaffold/dev VOCDONI_ENVIRONMENT=dev yarn build
```

### Custom domain names

The custom domain names environment variable allows to map custom domains to organization ids, so that the homepage
rendered will be the mapped organization profile.

~~~bash
CUSTOM_ORGANIZATION_DOMAINS='{"deadcorp.com":"0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dead"}' yarn build
~~~

With the example above, accessing the app via the `deadcorp.com` domain would render the profile of the organization
with id `0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dead` as the homepage of the app.

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br /> Open
[http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to view it in the browser (note
the port may change if already used).

#### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.<br /> It correctly bundles
React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

#### `yarn translations`

Extracts all i18n strings from the code and puts them in the `i18n/locales` json
files. The best way to work with translations is:

### Branching and deploys

Three branches are linked to deploys:

- [![GitHub Actions Workflow Status][build badge develop]][app-dev.vocdoni.io] linked to SaaS api-dev and vochain dev.
- [![GitHub Actions Workflow Status][build badge stage]][app-stg.vocdoni.io] linked to SaaS api-stg and vochain LTS.
- [![GitHub Actions Workflow Status][build badge main]][app.vocdoni.io] linked to SaaS api-lts and vochain LTS.

Also, all pushes to develop and stage are deployed to netlify. You can easily
access these deploys on each commit to develop, or directly in pull requests.

The common flow to follow when deploying to `main` is passing through all the
other stages:

    branch from develop => merge to develop => merge to stage => merge to main

The only exception should be when fixing specific versions to a deployment, in
such case, a hotfix should be created from the desired branch to be updated:

    branch from stage (i.e. h/sdk-0.4.1) => PR to stage
    branch from main (i.e. h/sdk-0.5.0) => PR to main

## Contributing

While we welcome contributions from the community, we do not track all of our issues on Github and we may not have the resources to onboard developers and review complex pull requests. That being said, there are multiple ways you can get involved with the project.

Please review our [development guidelines](https://developer.vocdoni.io/development-guidelines).

### Contributions and pull requests

To avoid unnecessary review overhead, **pull requests that only fix typos, whitespace, punctuation, or other minor changes without functional impact or clear added value will not be accepted**. If you want to correct such issues, please open an issue first. If the change is considered necessary, it may be accepted as a dedicated pull request that groups those corrections together. Accepted contributions must provide a clear benefit, whether through functional improvements, meaningful documentation updates, or the implementation of a feature or bug fix. Minor changes should be made with consideration and strong justification to avoid unnecessary distractions for reviewers.
