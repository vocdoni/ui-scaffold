**Improving Participatory Democracy on City Councils with Vocdoni**

City Councils are at the forefront of using innovative and interactive methods for determining how municipalities are democratically governed. They are in the unique position of regularly fostering the trust of community members and achieving the high participation levels needed to engage in more direct forms of democracy,[1] but they lack the resources to develop their own solutions. Municipal governments are often hindered by high election costs,[2] a lack of poll workers due to polling place harassment, and a significant burden of maintaining election security.[3] City Councils need efficient voting technology that encourages participation by being flexible and easy to use while decreasing their security and administration costs.

Vocdoni can be a game-changing solution for City Council elections. Our voting system fulfills the requirements of municipal governments by allowing residents to participate in a wide range of governance processes easily from their own devices, all the while providing high levels of security and transparency worthy of the voters' trust. Our adaptable voting protocol supports several democratic decision-making tools at a low cost from within a single interface. The award-winning Vocdoni protocol has been used by many government entities, with reliable and powerful results.

## The Future of Digital Democracy in Municipal Elections

The most successful city councils are those that engage frequently and directly with residents, building trust and showing constituents that their opinions are valued. As online voting tools become more flexible, inexpensive, and easy to use, several democratic processes become increasingly common and essential for effective participatory governance.

### These include:

#### **Referenda on Local Issues**

Binding polls on specific issues, giving residents a voice in policy decisions such as zoning laws, public projects, or bylaw changes. Constituents can approve or reject a policy proposal directly from their phones.

Vocdoni lowers the cost and labor of administering polls so that these referenda become reasonable to administer regularly for individual policies. Similarly, it lowers the barrier to entry and drastically increases the ease with which residents can cast their votes, enabling regular participation in lower-stakes policy polls. Vocdoni’s real-time result tracking and universal verifiability ensure that all votes are counted accurately and transparently.

#### **Budget Approvals**

Elections to approve or reject a proposed municipal budget. Detailed budget proposals are presented to residents, who can then vote to approve or reject these proposals.

Vocdoni provides a clear and straightforward voting process, enabling residents to make informed decisions on budget approvals with ease and confidence. The adaptable interface could include a summary of a budget proposal, embed a video explaining the implications of the proposal, direct voters through a detailed graphic explanation of the proposed budget, or all of the above.

#### **Participatory Budgeting**

A democratic process in which community members decide how to allocate a portion of a municipal or public budget from a set of options proposed by community members. Residents propose and vote on various budgetary allocations. Proposals receive funds either by receiving the most votes or in proportion to their number of votes.

Vocdoni ensures a secure and inclusive participatory budgeting process, encouraging more residents to take part in local decision-making and fostering a sense of community ownership. The interface can be customized to creatively exhibit the various proposals and give voters a sense of how their funds will be allocated.

#### **Public Opinion Polling**

Surveys to gauge public opinion on various issues or proposals. Residents participate in non-binding polls that gather opinions on specific topics or future initiatives.

Vocdoni provides an efficient platform for conducting public opinion polls, offering insights into community preferences and guiding council decisions.

#### **Special Elections**

Elections to fill vacancies or address urgent issues that arise between regular election cycles. Special elections must be conducted swiftly and securely, ensuring minimal disruption to governance.

Vocdoni allows for the rapid organization and execution of special elections, maintaining the continuity of governance and representation. The high levels of built-in security and universal verifiability mean voters can trust the results, allowing special elections to be organized rapidly but not sloppily.

## Case Study: Bellpuig Council

### First Public Institution in Spain Holds Vocdoni Referendum

Bellpuig Mayor Jordi Estiarte reached out to Vocdoni with the goal of digitalizing his town’s voting processes as part of an election promise to increase direct citizen participation.

Vocdoni is a digital voting system built using decentralized technology. It meets the highest standards of security, auditability, and accessibility required for public and private governance while remaining versatile and cost-effective.

Bellpuig is a town of around 5,000 people, in the county of Urgell in Catalonia, Spain. The mountainous region boasts striking natural scenery and beautiful Renaissance religious architecture, including the tomb of Catalan statesman Ramón de Cardona.

Institutional integration is key to further acceptance and implementation. Bellpuig Council’s partnership with Vocdoni validates the demand for guaranteed, universally verifiable, and censorship-resistant electronic voting. It is a sure sign that mainstream understanding of the potential value of utilizing decentralized technologies like blockchain to securely and transparently conduct public governance is increasing.

### **Voting with Vocdoni**

All 3,458 citizens eligible to vote—those over 16—received a document in the post explaining the public consultation. It also contained an individualized QR code that enabled them to vote remotely 24/7 after scanning it and introducing their access details. Residents needing support or those without electronic devices, such as the elderly, could otherwise vote in person, using the same QR code, at a polling station set up inside the town hall. This ensured that no one would be excluded from the civic right to democracy.

1095 residents exercised their right to vote in this governance process (31.67% of eligible voters) – an unprecedentedly high turnout for a non-binding local referendum. There were 632 ‘Yes’ votes, 436 ‘No’ votes, and 27 blank ballots.

### **Digital Governance in Bellpuig**

Bellpuig’s council initially transitioned to an online consultation due to the pandemic, but swiftly realized all the benefits it had to offer.

> _"We thought that this was the direction where consultations would be headed anyway... Citizens can make their voice heard in the comfort of their homes or workplace. Even if they’re abroad traveling, they can still exercise their right to vote from across the globe."_ – Mayor Jordi Estiarte

This referendum, the first-ever **100% digital consultation held by a public institution in Spain**, demonstrates the tangible value of accessible, transparent, and secure digital governance for democracy and society.
