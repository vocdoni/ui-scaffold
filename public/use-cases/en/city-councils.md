## Improving participatory democracy on city councils with Vocdoni

City Councils are at the forefront of using innovative and interactive methods to determine how municipalities are democratically governed. They are in a unique position to foster community trust and achieve the high participation levels needed for direct forms of democracy.[^1] However, they often lack the resources to develop their own solutions. Municipal governments face challenges like high election costs,[^2] a lack of poll workers due to polling place harassment, and significant election security burdens.[^3] City Councils need efficient voting technology that is flexible, easy to use, and reduces security and administration costs.

Vocdoni can be a game-changing solution for City Council elections. Our voting system enables residents to easily participate in governance processes from their own devices, providing high levels of security and transparency. Vocdoni supports several democratic decision-making tools at a low cost, all within a single interface. The award-winning Vocdoni protocol has been successfully used by many government entities, delivering reliable and powerful results.

## The future of digital democracy in municipal elections

The most successful city councils are those that engage frequently and directly with residents, building trust and demonstrating that constituents' opinions matter. As online voting tools become more flexible, affordable, and user-friendly, democratic processes become increasingly essential for effective participatory governance.

### Key democratic processes

#### Referenda on local issues

Binding polls on specific issues, such as zoning laws, public projects, or bylaw changes, give residents a direct voice in policy decisions. Constituents can approve or reject proposals directly from their phones.

Vocdoni reduces the cost and labor of administering these polls, making it feasible to conduct them regularly. The system increases participation by simplifying the voting process, enabling residents to vote with ease. Vocdoni’s real-time result tracking and universal verifiability ensure transparency and accuracy.

#### Budget approvals

Elections to approve or reject a proposed municipal budget. Detailed budget proposals are presented to residents, who vote on whether to approve or reject them.

Vocdoni simplifies the voting process, helping residents make informed decisions on budget approvals. The adaptable interface can feature budget summaries, videos explaining proposals, and visual aids to guide voters through the process.

#### Participatory budgeting

A democratic process in which community members decide how to allocate a portion of a municipal or public budget from a set of options proposed by residents. Proposals are voted on, and funds are allocated based on votes received.

Vocdoni ensures a secure and inclusive participatory budgeting process, encouraging more residents to engage in local decision-making and fostering a sense of community ownership. The interface can creatively display various proposals, giving voters a clear sense of how their funds will be allocated.

#### Public opinion polling

Surveys to gauge public opinion on various issues or proposals. Residents participate in non-binding polls to gather opinions on specific topics or future initiatives.

Vocdoni provides an efficient platform for conducting public opinion polls, offering insights into community preferences and guiding council decisions.

#### Special elections

Elections to fill vacancies or address urgent issues between regular election cycles. Special elections must be conducted swiftly and securely, ensuring minimal disruption to governance.

Vocdoni allows for the rapid organization and execution of special elections, maintaining governance continuity. The high levels of built-in security and universal verifiability ensure voter trust, allowing these elections to be organized quickly and efficiently.

## Case study: Bellpuig council

### First public institution in Spain holds Vocdoni referendum

Bellpuig Mayor Jordi Estiarte reached out to Vocdoni with the goal of digitalizing his town’s voting processes as part of an election promise to increase direct citizen participation.

Vocdoni is a digital voting system built using decentralized technology. It meets the highest standards of security, auditability, and accessibility required for public and private governance while remaining versatile and cost-effective.

Bellpuig, a town of about 5,000 people in Catalonia, Spain, boasts striking natural scenery and beautiful Renaissance religious architecture, including the tomb of Catalan statesman Ramón de Cardona.

Institutional integration is key to further acceptance and implementation. Bellpuig Council’s partnership with Vocdoni validates the demand for guaranteed, universally verifiable, and censorship-resistant electronic voting. This partnership signals that decentralized technologies like blockchain are increasingly seen as valuable tools for securely and transparently conducting public governance.

### Voting with Vocdoni

All 3,458 citizens eligible to vote—those over 16—received a document in the mail explaining the public consultation. It also contained an individualized QR code, enabling them to vote remotely 24/7 after scanning it and entering their access details. Residents needing support or those without electronic devices, such as the elderly, could vote in person at a polling station set up inside the town hall using the same QR code. This ensured no one would be excluded from exercising their civic right.

1,095 residents voted in this governance process (31.67% of eligible voters)—an unprecedentedly high turnout for a non-binding local referendum. There were 632 ‘Yes’ votes, 436 ‘No’ votes, and 27 blank ballots.

### Digital governance in Bellpuig

Bellpuig’s council initially transitioned to online consultation due to the pandemic but quickly recognized its benefits.

> _"We thought that this was the direction where consultations would be headed anyway... Citizens can make their voice heard in the comfort of their homes or workplaces. Even if they’re abroad, they can still exercise their right to vote from anywhere in the world."_

> Mayor Jordi Estiarte

This referendum, the first-ever **100% digital consultation held by a public institution in Spain**, demonstrates the tangible value of accessible, transparent, and secure digital governance for democracy and society.
