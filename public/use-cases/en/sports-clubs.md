## Engaging membership and lowering administrative burden with Vocdoni

Sports clubs can face nearly as much public scrutiny as governments, with elections of club  
officials requiring high levels of security and public confidence. Technical difficulties can lead to  
allegations of fraud, so sports clubs need voting systems that can be guaranteed to handle a  
large number of votes seamlessly. At the same time, however, sports clubs are not  
governments; rather than facing the scrutiny of election regulations, they are responsible to a  
base of voluntary members. In order to maintain an active and committed membership,[1] they  
need to ensure members feel heard by engaging regularly with the community and holding polls  
for approval of major expenditures, changes to club policies, and other important decisions.  
Sports clubs need secure and scalable voting technology that can accommodate a range of  
decision-making types while reducing the administrative burden for club leaders.

Vocdoni can be a game-changing solution for sports clubs. Our voting system fulfills the  
requirements of both large-scale official elections and higher-frequency member engagement  
processes like opinion polling and voting on policy decisions. Members can trust the  
transparency and security of our system while participating from their own devices, using an  
interface that feels more like a social media platform than an impersonal governmental ballot.  
Vocdoni gives organizations access to an award-winning voting system that is relied on by many  
government entities.

## The future of digital democracy in sports clubs

Research shows that the most successful organizations are those with an active and committed  
member base. Recruiting new members is at least five times more costly than retaining the  
current membership, and in a business context, "increasing customer retention rates by 5%  
increases profits by 25% to 95%."[2] Membership engagement is key to retaining an active  
community, with experts recommending frequent, low-effort polls and meaningful interactions  
where members feel some ownership of the organization.[3] In the case of more traditional club  
elections, distrust in election security or lack of transparency can significantly undermine  
members’ likelihood of participating in elections,[4] reducing their sense of belonging within the  
club.

Sports clubs already produce high levels of trust among community members, an effect that  
spills over and increases the strength and trust of surrounding communities.[5] Club officials can  
further become leaders in building community trust with universally verifiable elections and  
various types of direct member democracy.

## These include:

### Election of club officials

Traditional large-scale election including all active members of the association. Members vote  
from a list of candidates.  
Vocdoni lowers the cost of administering large-scale elections while maintaining high levels of  
security. Our flexible system allows for different voting types, such as ranked-choice voting, and  
can easily handle elections containing millions of voters. Members can vote from their phones or  
computers. Vocdoni’s real-time result tracking and universal verifiability ensure that all votes are  
counted accurately and transparently.

### Approval of major expenditures

Elections to approve or reject a proposed expenditure, such as a stadium renovation. Detailed  
budget proposals are presented to members, who can then vote to approve or reject them.  
Vocdoni provides a clear and straightforward voting process, enabling members to make  
informed decisions on expenditure approvals with ease and confidence. The adaptable interface  
could include a summary of a proposal, embed a video explaining the implications of the  
proposal, include graphic representations of the budget or planned improvement, or all of the  
above.

### Changes to club policies

While many policies are determined by governing bodies, members feel more ownership of the  
association if they are allowed to have a say on policy changes.  
Vocdoni drastically lowers the cost of having a secure, transparent voting process. It also lowers  
the cost to voters, implementing a seamless registration and voting flow on members’ own  
devices. This enables higher-frequency, more interactive democratic processes, meaning more  
decisions can be put to community approval. Elections could be simple yes/no decisions on a  
single proposal or could include a more iterative community-driven process to choose between  
and approve various amendments to a policy.

### Member polling

Surveys to gauge community opinion on various issues or proposals. Members participate in  
non-binding polls that gather opinions on specific topics or future initiatives.  
Vocdoni provides an efficient platform for conducting opinion polls, offering insights into  
community preferences and guiding association decisions. Non-binding member polling  
increases member satisfaction and makes a membership body more likely to remain active in  
the future.[6]

## Case study:

### FC Barcelona goes digital: A secure and transparent blockchain voting system with Vocdoni

**Revolutionizing fan engagement with digital elections**

FC Barcelona, one of the world's most renowned football clubs, faced a significant challenge:  
how to engage its global fanbase in governance decisions while ensuring security, transparency,  
and accessibility. The _Consell Consultiu de Penyes_ (Fan Club Advisory Council) elections had  
traditionally been held in person, limiting participation to those physically present in Barcelona.  
To overcome this barrier, FC Barcelona turned to Vocdoni, leveraging its cutting-edge  
blockchain-based voting system to conduct its first fully digital election.

### How it worked: A seamless, secure, and transparent voting process

The election was designed to enable fan club members (_penyes_) from around the world to vote  
remotely while ensuring the integrity of the process. Vocdoni’s technology provided a  
tamper-proof, universally verifiable, and privacy-preserving election platform. Key components  
of the voting system included:

1. **Secure and anonymous voting with 2FA**  
   To guarantee voter eligibility and prevent fraud, participants had to authenticate their identity  
   using a two-factor authentication (2FA) process. This involved verifying their membership  
   credentials and receiving a unique code via SMS, ensuring that only eligible voters could  
   participate.

2. **End-to-end encryption & universal verifiability**  
   Vocdoni’s blockchain voting system implemented advanced cryptographic techniques,  
   including blind signatures, to separate voter identities from their votes. This approach ensured  
   that while votes were counted accurately, voter anonymity was maintained. Additionally, every  
   vote was recorded immutably on the blockchain, allowing independent verification without  
   compromising voter privacy.

3. **Public and transparent ballot box**  
   One of the revolutionary aspects of this digital election was the use of blockchain as a  
   decentralized and publicly auditable voting ledger. Unlike traditional elections that rely on  
   central authorities to announce results, Vocdoni’s system allowed any observer to verify and  
   replicate all transactions, check the integrity of voter lists, and perform an independent vote  
   tally.

4. **Censorship-resistant and resilient by design**  
   The decentralized nature of the voting infrastructure ensured that no single entity could  
   manipulate or block the process. If any node in the system was compromised, voters could  
   seamlessly connect through other gateways, ensuring uninterrupted access.

### Results & impact

- **Increased participation:** Thousands of international members could cast their votes remotely, ensuring broader representation.
- **Enhanced security & fraud prevention:** The blockchain recorded every vote immutably, preventing tampering.
- **Lower costs & operational efficiency:** Digital voting significantly reduced logistical and administrative expenses.
- **Improved transparency & trust:** The system’s open-source nature allowed anyone to audit the process.

## Why this matters for other sports organizations

This successful implementation by FC Barcelona serves as a model for other sports clubs looking to enhance democratic engagement.
