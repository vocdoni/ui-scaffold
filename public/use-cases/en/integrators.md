## **Embedding digital voting software with Vocdoni**

Software Developers who provide governance platforms to organizations commonly focus on usability, accessibility, and features like analytics. Designing a voting system with security and verifiability at the forefront is an expensive task that takes years of development, conflicting with the needs and goals of software companies.  
Vocdoni allows for easy third-party integration of its powerful voting protocol, extracting the responsibility for security and system design away from integrators and allowing them to focus on user experience, features, and marketing. Our protocol is thoroughly tested for reliability and security and is one-of-a-kind in allowing for universal verifiability of every single vote without compromising on anonymity. Vocdoni allows integrators to provide their clients with a thoroughly tested, reliable, open-source voting platform trusted by many government entities.

## **Integration**

Vocdoni provides both a **JavaScript SDK** and a **REST API**, allowing developers to easily integrate our powerful protocol into their products without worrying about the complexity of a modern voting system. We host the distributed infrastructure that powers our protocol, but integrators can also choose to run the entire stack on their own servers.  
Vocdoni’s flexible protocol allows for a wide range of voting types including **quadratic voting, ranked-choice voting, and weighted voting**. The protocol is **universally verifiable**, meaning that anyone can independently check the validity of every single vote and the election results as a whole. At the same time, the protocol allows for very high levels of cryptographic anonymity, meaning even election administrators cannot correlate a voter with their ballot.  
As far as we are aware, Vocdoni is the only system in existence that provides **verifiability and anonymity**. Based on blockchain technology, the protocol is also **censorship-resistant**, and election results cannot be deleted.  
Vocdoni provides developers with a **powerful voting system**, allowing them to boast the highest levels of security and transparency while focusing on features and user interfaces.
